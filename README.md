# üìö LearningRoom ‚Äì An AI-powered Learning Platform

## üöÄ Project Description

*LearningRoom* is an innovative educational platform designed to enhance student engagement and retention. Unlike traditional tools like Google Classroom that function merely as content repositories, LearningRoom enables faculty to create digital classrooms where they can upload lecture notes (PDFs). The system automatically analyzes these notes using AI to:

- Break them down into topic-specific modules.
- Generate unlimited quizzes and flashcards for revision.
- Provide a context-aware chatbot for summaries and doubt clarification.
- Track student progress using performance analytics.

The platform empowers both students and faculty by promoting active learning, easy revision, and intelligent feedback loops for better academic outcomes.

## üß† Problem Statement

Current e-learning platforms, such as Google Classroom, serve primarily as file storage with minimal student engagement features. They do not support learning reinforcement, progress tracking, or content comprehension tools.

*LearningRoom* solves these issues by:
- Enabling automatic content modularization for better comprehension.
- Supporting unlimited topic-wise quizzes and flashcards to improve retention.
- Providing a PDF-aware chatbot for summarization, key points, and question resolution.
- Offering analytics to identify strengths, weaknesses, and overall course progress.
  
This intelligent learning assistant transforms passive content consumption into active and adaptive learning experiences.
